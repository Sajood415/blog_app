# Blog Website

## Project Overview

This is a Blog Website where user can login and create blog. User will be able to edit and delete his blog and able to view other users blogs. For the front-end of the website I have used React JS and Material UI for the designing of the components. For backend I have used Express JS and Mongo DB for saving the blogs. For the authentication and login system I have used Okta authentication. User can be added by the admin manually in the Okta admin dashboard. Sign up module of Okta authentication is paid.
